# Introduction

## Background on the Poudre River

[Cache La Poudre River](https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/summary/205018) is an important watershed that supports **agriculture, industry, recreation, and residential needs** on the Front Range of Colorado. It also provides for cottonwood forest, shrub, and grassland ecosystems that support [wildlife](http://poudretrail.org/habitat-wildlife/#fish) from the mountains down to the prairies. The unique **biodiversity** and **history** of the Cache La Poudre watershed are valued widely; 45 miles along the Poudre are encompassed in a [National Heritage Area](https://www.nps.gov/places/cache-la-poudre-river-national-heritage-area.htm).
The history of Cache La Poudre is linked to the *history of the West*, because its banks supported the first major [irrigation-based agricultural settlement](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy2.library.colostate.edu/stable/pdf/1821074.pdf) of its kind in 1870, which would soon spread through the Arid West.
